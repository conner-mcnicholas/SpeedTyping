# SpeedTyping

The python Jupyter Notebook wpm_patterns.ipynb analyzes raw data in wpmdaily.csv, pulled from MonkeyType.com's daily English top 1000 fastest 60 second leaderboard.  

The motivation being: to quantify the likelihood that my hardware is sending bad signals by understanding the relationships and patterns within the distribution of typists speed, accuracy, and consistency.

I will attain reasonable speeds (111wpm) despite incredibly low accuracy (85%).  This is the rate referenced in the charts.  My personal best of 121wpm had an accuracy of 95%, but that was prior to my accuracy and wpm rates inexplicably decreasing.

The exercise seemed to support this hypothesis.  Across 1000 other typers in the daily fastest on 60sec mode, there is only a couple users with similary anomolous results.    

This is by no means conclusive, and was not intended to serve as such.  These could just be true anomolies.
