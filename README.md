# SpeedTyping

The python Jupyter Notebook wpm_patterns.ipynb analyzes raw data in wpmdaily.csv, pulled from MonkeyType.com's daily English top 1000 fastest 60 second leaderboard.  

The motivation being: to quantify the likelihood that my hardware is sending bad signals by understanding the relationships and patterns within the distribution of typists speed, accuracy, and consistency.

I will attain reasonable speeds (111wpm) despite incredibly low accuracy (85%).  This is the rate referenced in the charts.  My personal best of 121wpm had an accuracy of 95%, but that was prior to my accuracy and wpm rates inexplicably decreasing.

The exercise seemed to support this hypothesis.  Across 1000 other typers in the daily fastest on 60sec mode, there are only a couple users with similary anomolous results:

Although the distribution is quite skewed, it is worth noting that my accuracy rate is 4.5 standard deviations below the mean:

Box plots give richer detail, but tell the same story:

Is it almost certain that I'm just a typological freak, and these metrics are simply depicting my extraordinary sloppiness?  Yes.  

Would I rather spend a couple hours making overly complicated charts pointing the accusatory finger (or all 10 of them) at my potentially defective keyboard?
